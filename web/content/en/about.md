## DeepCausality


DeepCausality is a hyper-geometric computational causality library that enables fast and deterministic context aware
causal reasoning over complex multi-stage causality models. Deep Causality adds only minimal overhead,
and thus is suitable for real-time applications without additional acceleration hardware. See the [documentation for more](/docs/intro/).


## Who wrote DeepCausality?


DeepCausality was written by [Marvin Hansen](https://github.com/marvin-hansen) and is used at his 
company [Emet-Labs](https://emet-labs.com/).

## Linux Foundation


DeepCausality is hosted as a sandbox project at the [Linux Foundation for data and artificial intelligence](https://lfaidata.foundation/) (LF AI & Data Foundation).
