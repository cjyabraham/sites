The Technical Advisory Group to the Linux Foundation AI & Data unanimously voted to accept
DeepCausality into the Foundation on On Aug/10, 2023. Following the vote, the subsequent onboarding process 
was successfully completed, resulting in the admission of DeepCausality. DeepCausality is now listed as an official project in the [LF AI & Data landscape](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/?selected=deep-causality).
