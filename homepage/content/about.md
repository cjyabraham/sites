# DeepCausality

DeepCausality is a hyper-geometric computational causality library that enables fast and deterministic context aware
causal reasoning over complex multi-stage causality models. Deep Causality adds only minimal overhead,
and thus is suitable for real-time applications without additional acceleration hardware.

# Why DeepCausality?

1) DeepCausality is written in Rust with production grade safety, reliability, and performance in mind.
2) DeepCausality provides recursive causal data-structures that enable concise expression of arbitrary complex causal
   structures.
3) DeepCausality enables context awareness across data-like, time-like, space-like, spacetime-like entities stored
   within (multiple) context-hyper-graphs.
4) DeepCausality simplified modelling of complex tempo-spatial patterns.
5) DeepCausality is small, efficient, and fast, really fast.
